eXO is a simple Tic-Tac-To implementation, created by Moose.

eXO was made using the C programming language, using defualt
libraries included with compilers. No operating system-dependent
libraries were used.

eXO was created by Moosespecs. All source of eXO is free to use
and free to be modified and redistributed; eXO is a free and
open-source project.

|| How To Play ||
\\=============//



Controlling the game is straightforward.
First type in the space you want to occupy, followed by
the symbol you wish to occupy it.


 | ^ | ^ | ^ |
 
 | ^ | ^ | ^ |
 
 | ^ | ^ | ^ |

The '^' symbol denotes an empty space.


Using the input:

 > 3 x

places an 'X' symbol in the 3rd space.



 | ^ | ^ | X |
 
 | ^ | ^ | ^ |
 
 | ^ | ^ | ^ |



Next, using the input:

 > 2 o

places an 'O' symbol in the 2nd space.



 | ^ | O | X |
 
 | ^ | ^ | ^ |
 
 | ^ | ^ | ^ |



The game is won by lining up the same symbols
in a row.

Here's examples of winning positions:



 | ^ | X | ^ |
 
 | ^ | X | ^ |
 
 | ^ | X | ^ |



 | O | ^ | ^ |
 
 | ^ | O | ^ |
 
 | ^ | ^ | O |





 | ^ | ^ | ^ |
 
 | O | O | O |
 
 | ^ | ^ | ^ |



 | ^ | ^ | X |
 
 | ^ | X | ^ |
 
 | X | ^ | ^ |

Thank you for checking out eXO, whether that is just
browsing source or actually playing the game. I created
this just as practice using the C programming language,
which I'm very rusty on!
